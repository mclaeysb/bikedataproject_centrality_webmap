# A Leaflet template

## Getting started

To read up on making webmaps using Mapbox GL, take a look at [these examples](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/).

To edit this webmap, open the `index.html`, `map.js` and `style.css` files in a text editor.

To view this webmap, start a local http server (for example at this directory and on port 8080) and open the `index.html` file in you browser on the corresponding port via `localhost:8080/index.html`

Using a local http server for the first time? If you're familiar with NodeJS, we can recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but there are other options out there aswel, including MAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.

Happy mapping!
