# Brussels Cycling Potential

We try to predict how useful each specific road segment would be for an average cycling trip, and compare with the actual bike trip count on that segment.

*Let's find out which roads are under- or over-used - and why!*

## Getting started editing this map

To read up on making webmaps using Mapbox GL, take a look at [these examples](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/).

To edit this webmap, open the `index.html`, `map.js` and `style.css` files in a text editor.

To view this webmap, start a local http server (for example at this directory and on port 8080) and open the `index.html` file in you browser on the corresponding port via `localhost:8080/index.html`

Using a local http server for the first time? If you're familiar with NodeJS, we can recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but there are other options out there aswel, including MAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.

Happy mapping!
